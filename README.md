# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

## Data Structures

By definition, a **data structure** is a collection of data values, the relationship among them and, the functions/operations that can be applied to the data.[1]

#### Abstract Data Types

- Model or logical description for a given data structure
- It is like a supertype in programming
- We just define what properties (methods/functions) a data structure will have - the basic behavioral attributes of a data structure
- Concrete implementation is not specified
- Stack, Queue, Priority Queue, Dictionary are some examples of ADT

> Note: Array, linked list, heap, etc., are some examples of the data structures that can be used to implement the ADTs.
